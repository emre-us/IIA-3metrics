# <center>**GAUSS-MARKOV THEOREM**</center>

This is the theoretical justification for using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The Theorem states that under a set of conditions known as the **Gauss-Markov conditions**, the OLS estimator is the **B**est **L**inear conditionally **U**nbiased **E**stimator (**BLUE**).

## OLS
Consider the problem of finding the estimator $b$ that minimizes
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n
(X_i-b)^2.
\]
This is a measure of the total squared gap between the estimator $b$ and the sample points.
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
$\hookrightarrow$
The gap $(X_i - b)$ can be thought of as a prediction mistake since $b$ is an estimator of $\mathbb{E}(X) and can be thought of as a prediction of the value of $X_i.$
